# TidyStacksSecBlog
Created this simple blog project for my first bootcamp project where I learnt how to create and deploy a secure cloud environment using Microsoft Azure. 

The project required two blog posts but being a total geek for web development, I did a few extra miles.  What this means is I created my own custom HTML and CSS for the assignment.  I took inspiration from the Avast AV website that uses blues and oranges in its color palette.  This bold color scheme along with an accessible writing style hopefully makes cybersecurity feel like an approachable and attainable goal for everyone. 

Included in this repository are text files for the blog posts if you want to read those outside of a styled context, the image files used for the project and HTML and CSS sheets.
