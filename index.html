     <p>Let me paint you a picture: You're happily scrolling away on social media. You found a really good dog meme page when you happen to steal a quick gaze at the side lines of the webpage and you see it. It's an advertisement for the best dog spa you could possibly want your bestest pal in the whole wide world to go to. You're left with the feeling:...But like how did they know? But they <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wqn3gR1WTcA" class="blink">know</a>. Trust that they know. But who's they and what do they know and how do they know? Internet Advertising uses a bunch of different <a class="blink" href="https://www.avg.com/en/signal/what-is-ad-tracking?utm_source=commissionjunction&utm_medium=affiliate&utm_campaign=100357191&utm_content=14497570&couponfield=yes&cjevent=2f4d8819f95611ec810047f10a1c0e11"> techniques</a>- we should call it internet glitter because it impossible to get rid of- such as your browsing history, emails, your IP address, and even cookies.  And really that's what I wanted to talk to you about: Your cookies. Your cookies are small files your internet browser saves so you have an easier time when you visit your favorite sites - think of it as a save game file- but there are other kinds of cookies. There are advertising cookies normally owned by an ad company that follow you around the internet and help gather all that information to deliever you hat pawsome dog spa ad. Does that seem awfully snoopy - and not in the adorble and beloved dog comic way- absolutely. However, there are things you can do to be better in charge of what the folks like to call in the industry -your data! First off, get into the habit of using a <a href="https://us.norton.com/internetsecurity-privacy-what-is-a-vpn.html" class="blink">VPN</a> among other things, it helps hide your IP (basically your internet street address) from these cookies and add a level of anonymity to your internet adventuring. Most importantly, is to not ignore those pop under ads you see now on most websites. Those pop unders are a result of the <a href="https://termly.io/resources/articles/what-is-gdpr/" class="blink">GDPR</a> in Europe you might have heard about and the <a href="https://termly.io/resources/articles/ccpa/" class="blink">CCPA</a> in the United States that want to give you a helping hand and not letting your data get taken for walk. The best sites will give you a reject all and the worst ones might not give you an option at all other than to accept. However, the middle of the road sites will give you an option. Click on them. It will slow your adventure up a bit but picture it as placing your favorite order at a coffee shop: You'll get your buzz handcrafted the way you like it. In the menu you'll be able to opt out of a lot of things they would otherwise collect. In the that menu, you won't be able to opt out of the cookies that the website needs to function but everything else that they given important sounding names to like 'functional cookies' are all optional and unnecessary for the site to collect. So long story short, you probably should take your bestest pal to that dog spa because we know they are the goodest. Also, you should now be able to stop some of your data getting off leash and getting into all sorts of mischief. </p>

      <p>Who wouldnt want think before you click needlepointed on a pillow? Bet there's someone on Etsy who will gladly oblige should you be so inclined. If not someday that's definately going to be in my merch store... you know when this blog takes off! The point is and it's related to my first blog post which you should read -btw. Is how often do you just click on something without <a href="https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/KuPau4wNf3Lq4zUqmmGyg4L9n9NNAxOuCark1Ol0SdaHE9t3FqF3Nx2x54FSppg8i4YX4okb7_RfyYoFrwrWbE0geLh--51Kw0CXYm02CQX50zW_w8x-VBIeBkUnLETWa2mNYSSZ" class="blink">thinking?</a> Before clicking on anything anywhere, especially in either a direct message on social media or email, did I ask for this link? No seriously. Lines like "Come Check Out My Small Shop" and "here's the link to my Google drive" should send you running at your top speed miles(or kilometers) in the other direction! This is known as <a href="https://www.malwarebytes.com/phishing" class="blink"> phishing</a> in the sense they are trying to reel you in to lighten you wallet in on way or another or more devastatingly steal your username and password. Yeah I know some of you are using the same username and <a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/create-and-use-strong-passwords-c5cebb49-8c53-4f5e-2bc4-fe357ca048eb" class="blink"> password</a> for all your accounts. While this is a horrible idea - and really I would recommend you going through your most important accounts and making them all wonderfully unique- or you know get a <a href ="https://www.nytimes.com/wirecutter/reviews/best-password-managers/" class="blink">password manager</a>!- At least follow some basic internet hygiene and do not click on things you haven't specifically requested! It is also important to add that even if it comes from a trusted source like say your Great Great Aunt Batilda - you know the one that always sends a generous 20$ bill on your birthday- can be sus. It would be a good idea before clicking on anything that gives your Spidey-senses (Peter Tingle?) a trigger to go ahead a reach out to your friend or relative that sent you the thing to ask if they meant to send you that or if its really obvious- you know the ones: A Royal friend who has fallen on hard times...Let them know they've been subject to some mischief and they need to change their passwords ASAHP. So the takeaway here you need to remember is: Think before you click because you never know what could be on the otherside of a link... or who is on the otherside of a link.</p>
